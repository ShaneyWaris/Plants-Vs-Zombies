# Plants-Vs-Zombies
This game is the final project of my "Advance Programming" course in third semester.
## Technology: Java, JavaFX  

# Project Deadline-1: UML Diagram
For this deadline, we need to create the UML diagrams of our project: 
1) Class diagram for NON-GUI components.
2) Use case diagram for complete project (including GUI components).

# Project Deadline-2: GUI Programming
For this deadline, we need to write the code that shows the static GUI components in our project. We have to upload some portion of animations as well. Static GUI means we should show the events but need not implement the corresponding event handlers. This deadline will simply test "how your project look" for supporting all the project requirements. As an example, for a project that implements the email login page, the static GUI components are: a) login page with name of email service, b) text box for username, c) text box for password and d) submit button. How the submit button will actually work is not the part of static GUI components.

# Project Deadline-3: Final Project
For this deadline, we have to submit the complete project and presentation. This deadline will consists of 10% in total. 8% marks will be based on rubric covering functionality of the project. 2% marks will be based on presentation related to design and implementation. The presentation will consist of maximum 4 slides in which 3rd slide should be explaining the individual effort put by the teammates and 4th slide should be explaining about the bonus component if you have any. Demo will be taken based on the presentation and running application. Bonus will include the extra features implemented by you in the project.
